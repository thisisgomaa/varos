# Gate Log

Every work-order gate review is recorded here (charter §4). Format: order, branch, commit range, checks run, defects, verdict, merge commit.

## F1 — Inventory & classification

- **Date:** 2026-07-11. **Branch:** `codex/f1-inventory` (range `1aff281..2aa1c2f`, i.e. commits `74fdad7`, `cf59527`, `d3bbc17`, `96deeaf`, `2aa1c2f`). **Reviewer:** planner.
- **Checks run:**
  - Completeness: table paths extracted and set-compared against `git ls-tree -r 1aff281 --name-only` → 160/160 identical, 0 duplicates, 0 missing.
  - Dead-candidate safety: `git grep` for root `icon.png` and `varos/varos.ico` → zero real references (the two `include_bytes!("../icon.png")` hits resolve to `crates/varos-app/icon.png`).
  - Evidence sampling: 6 `Last` commit values re-derived via `git log -1 --format=%h -- <path>` → all matched.
  - DEPENDENCY_MAP: internal edges vs all 5 manifests, 8 external-dep purposes vs source, fork sweep vs independently verified 5-file list — verified (secondary reviewer, sonnet-tier).
  - OWNERSHIP_MAP: 28/28 modules present, 12 line-range samples read against source, 4 ownership truths verified (secondary reviewer, sonnet-tier).
  - Hygiene: diff scope = ci.yml + foundation docs only; `git diff --check` clean; no Rust source/fixture changes.
- **Defects found (round 1):** (1) fabricated wgpu evidence citation `tess.rs:256,636`; (2) `editor.rs` table gap 2760-2868; (3) forward-looking §7 in an as-is document; (4) "future command-boundary pressure point" wording; plus cosmetic line-number nits.
- **Fixes:** `96deeaf`, `2aa1c2f` (§7 content moved to `NOTES_FOR_CHARTER.md`). Point re-verified: tess.rs citation gone (bytemuck `tess.rs:7` citation verified real), tables contiguous 1-5563 / 1-4533, as-is purity restored.
- **Verdict:** PASS. **Merged:** `05b6dc7` to `main`, pushed.
- **Post-merge observation:** push auto-triggered CI run `29162831354`; job died in 2s with `runner_id: 0`, zero steps — GitHub account verification hold blocks runners (environmental, not a code failure). Ahmed's action item.
- *Honesty note: this entry was written retroactively the same day, after a charter self-review flagged that the F1 gate had no repository evidence trail. This file exists so every future gate leaves one.*
- Sign-off: planner — PASS — 2026-07-11

## Charter mutual review

- **Date:** 2026-07-11. **Document:** `FOUNDATION_CHARTER.md` draft v1 → v2.
- Planner self-review (sonnet-tier) found 7 defects in v1 (fixed same day). Codex counter-review found 8 blocking points — all verified and accepted: untracked risk register; golden round-trip invariant claimed but not implemented (`golden.rs` is load+assert only); F3 self-contradiction (private `apply_ops` untestable without scaffolding); F4 two-level `EditCommand`/`AppCommand` replaces the core-vs-app binary; F2a oversized → split into F2a.1-4 with defined denominators; `.varos` dashboard metric incoherent (current docs already at 0 — verified by grep across all 12 current-classified docs); per-commit gate claim unenforceable → branch-tip/merge-commit wording; unmeasurable/person-bound commitments moved to §4b or given markers, flags, and sign-off formats.
- **Verdict:** v2 ACCEPTED by Ahmed ("اعتمد"), including tracking both audit reports as the risk register.
- Sign-off: planner — v2 ready — 2026-07-11
- Sign-off: product owner (Ahmed) — ACCEPTED — 2026-07-11

## F2a.1 — Policy scaffolding

- **Date:** 2026-07-11. **Branch:** `codex/f2a1-policy` (range `27bcba8..9f89003`, commits `4988f65`, `76f8b31`, `e34648b`, `9f89003`). **Reviewer:** planner.
- **Checks run:**
  - Scope: diff = 8 `docs/adr/` files + `STATUS.md` + `tools/check_links.ps1`; zero `.rs`/`.toml`/`.lock` changes; no moves/deletes/stamping; `git diff --check` clean.
  - ADR content: all 7 drafts read in full by the reviewer — every Decision traces 1:1 to charter §6/§9/§10 (zero invented decisions); Supersedes lines correct (Constitution 14/17-20, CLAUDE.md:10, stale manifest comment); charter line citations spot-checked against the file.
  - Link checker: independently executed → `PASS (70 first-party docs, 71 relative links, 58 heading anchors)`, matching the implementer's report exactly; negative test (broken link injected into a tracked doc, then restored) → exit 1 with a named failure.
  - STATUS truthfulness: stamped denominator now defined (0/70); link-check row live.
- **Defects:** none — first zero-defect gate in the program.
- **Verdict:** PASS. **Merged:** `673b5df` to `main`.
- **Pending:** the 7 ADRs remain `Proposed` until the product owner accepts them (blocker for F2c and for F2a.3's Constitution/CLAUDE.md corrections).
- Sign-off: planner — PASS — 2026-07-11

## ADR acceptance

- **Date:** 2026-07-11. ADR-0001..0007 flipped `Proposed` → `Accepted` on the product owner's assent (relayed while dispatching F2a.2-4; the ADRs contain only decisions Ahmed had already made — recorded in charter §9 and the mutual-review record §10). Reversible by product-owner word before any dependent work merges.
- Sign-off: product owner (Ahmed, via planner) — ACCEPTED — 2026-07-11

## F2a.2 — Stamping

- **Date:** 2026-07-11. **Branch:** `codex/f2a2-stamping` (range `84463a7..c43ecf3`, commits `bab8001`, `a89e935`, `c43ecf3`). **Reviewer:** planner.
- **Checks run:**
  - Diff purity: 70 files / +70 / −0; every added line matches `^> \*\*Status:\*\*` (zero non-stamp additions); no `.rs`/`.toml`/`.lock` touched; `git diff --check` clean.
  - Classification fidelity: per-file stamp class compared programmatically against `INVENTORY.md` for every baseline doc → **0 mismatches**. Post-baseline docs judged sensibly: foundation+ADRs = current, `NOTES_FOR_CHARTER.md` = historical (absorbed into the charter), `ADR-0000-template.md` = reference, both audits = current (active risk register). Arithmetic closes: 27+18+25 = 70.
  - HTML safety: every HTML stamp sits immediately after `<body>` (never inside `<style>`/`<script>`); `UI_VISION_MOCKUP.html` has no body tag → line 1. Renders as a visible provenance line on archived prototypes — harmless.
  - Link check independently re-run: `PASS (70 docs, 71 links, 58 anchors)`.
  - Note (no action): `ELEMENTS_CATALOG.md` and `VISUAL_POLISH_PLAN.md` each contain one pre-existing legacy line that coincidentally starts with the stamp marker; file-level counts are unaffected.
- **Defects:** none.
- **Verdict:** PASS. **Merged:** `d0664d4` to `main`.
- Sign-off: planner — PASS — 2026-07-11
