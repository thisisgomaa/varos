# Varos STATUS — single current-state page

Authority level 3 (charter §3). Anything that contradicts this page is stale. Updated at every gate.

## Now

- **Program:** Architecture & Repository Foundation — charter ACCEPTED 2026-07-11 (`docs/foundation/FOUNDATION_CHARTER.md`).
- **F2a COMPLETE:** F2a.1 ✅ `673b5df` · F2a.2 ✅ `d0664d4` · F2a.3 ✅ `a10772e` (doc-truth P0s closed) · F2a.4 ✅ `76640fe` (vendor contract + machine check).
- **F2 COMPLETE 🎉** — F2a.1..4 ✅ · F2b ✅ `b6e3863` (docs root = 7 current docs; history/ 17 + reference/ 16) · F2c ✅ `3a0ad3b` (ADR-0005 edges machine-enforced).
- **F3 ✅** `b8c9ba6` · **F4.1 ✅** `bd8bc1f` — `EditCommand` lives in core; **zero direct document writes from the UI** (measured); hand-verified by the product owner on a branch release build.
- **P11.1 ✅** `1931c80` — 10.4× on the 300%-zoom scene, 9.6× on curves-100 (reviewer-reproduced), owner hand-verified. Tests: 239.
- **Active work order:** **P11.2** — (0) instant real-time zoom (glide easing removed — owner-authorized feel change, 2026-07-12); (1) viewport culling at path level (the scene-B/many-objects fix) **plus ring/edge-level clipping to the view rect** (the 4000%-zoom overdraw fix — owner-reported symptom (د); reuse the existing artboard clippers `scene.rs:617-736`); (2) cross-frame flatten cache with zoom buckets. F4.2 queued right after.
- **P11 remaining after P11.2:** hover/snap interaction costs (P11.3, only if still felt), undo-clone storage (measure first).
- **Upcoming decision for the product owner:** fate of `codex/p6-header` — must be decided before F5 (charter precondition).
- **F2b layout DECIDED 2026-07-11:** product owner delegated the choice ("اختار انت الصح"); planner selected **`docs/history/` + `docs/reference/`**, root `docs/` keeps current docs only; `design-reference/` stays in place.
- **ADRs:** ADR-0001..0007 **Accepted** by the product owner 2026-07-11 — highest authority per charter §3. F2a.3's Constitution/CLAUDE.md corrections and F2c are unblocked.
- **Last gate:** F4.1 — PASS (zero implementer defects; one planner process defect recorded honestly in GATE_LOG §F4.1) — merged `bd8bc1f`.
- **Risk register:** `docs/audits/2026-07-11-CODEX-FULL-PROJECT-AUDIT.md` + `docs/audits/2026-07-11-CLAUDE-COUNTER-REVIEW.md`.

## External action items (outside the repo)

- GitHub account billing verification — **deferred indefinitely by Ahmed, 2026-07-11.** Hosted CI stays unavailable (runs die with zero steps); the red ✗ on pushes is cosmetic. The program's real gates run locally (charter §4). Triggers stay enabled so CI self-activates if the hold ever clears. Repo visibility unchanged (going private would not lift the account-level hold).
- Branch protection + required checks — parked behind the item above.
- GitHub organization + second admin — parallel governance track (charter §9.5), no deadline. Owner: Ahmed.
